          Native plants offer a tough, verastile and beautiful alternative with
          lower maintenance to the imported, more exotic general nursery stock.
          Native plants are more suitable to local water, soil and pest
          conditions. Many of these native plants also serve as food for
          beautiful songbirds as well as hosts for many species of butterflies
          and moths. Once established, native plants can tough out drought and
          water restrictions that many other plants are unable to tolerate.

          There is always a native alternative to an exotic plant, and many
          times, the native species will be a much more interesting and
          spectacular specimen. Specific site requirements, such as low, soggy
          ground, or steep, dry slopes can become beautiful focal points with
          the right native plants in place.
