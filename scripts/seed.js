Only found in dry upland forest throughout the southeast. It will produce heavy crops of small acorns that drop early in the fall and are very low in tannin, which gives them a pleasant  taste. Deer and Turkey love this species of acorns as did primitive man because of the low tannin content. Excellent fall color, redish orange to burgundy. I grow mine in a large terra cotta pot on my patio and it makes a wonderful picturesque specimen with its multi trunked structure. Mature size is approximately 20-25' tall x 10' wide.",

It is pyramidal in shape when young with multiple, irregular branches emerging from a trunk covered with dark brown or grey, ridged bark. As the tree matures the base develops a swollen buttress and root foot print. Aborting the lower limbs  developing a spreading, flat-topped crown also is a interest sculptural characteristic when mature. The four to six-inch-long, dark green leaves are joined in early spring by dense, hanging clusters of small, white blooms. The 1.5-inch-long, showy red fruits on female trees are produced in abundance and ripen in autumn. The juice can be used as a substitute for limes, hence its common name. Fruits can make a slight mess of a sidewalk, driveway or patio. The anticipation of Fall color will reward you as the trees put on a brilliant display of colorful foliage ranging from vivid yellow to deep purple, which would make Ogeechee-Lime a popular landscape choice.

Lets start with the fact that most gardeners and garden center would look at you like a deer in headlights if you asked them about this species! It is a tall fast growing broad leaf evergreen tree that flowers from June to November producing pure white magnolia like flowers. The flowers are 2-3\" across and born in abundance and continuously all summer. Gordonia lasianthus can attain heights of 50-60\" but only get 15-20\"wide. It must be placed in a moist soils and will not tolerate drought. Ours was planted 2006, two years ago as a one gallon about 2' High at the time and now is 10'tall and 5'wide. This summer(08)so far it has produced near 150 flowers by September with more developing as I type.

The dark glossy green foilage of the American Persimmon can be used to make teas. American Persimmon is a member of the ebony family, and the wood is extremely hard and was used to make golf club heads and is still used to make billiard cues and handles for tools.

Ilex decidua is a drought tolerant species of Holly in which the name implies, drops it's foliage in the fall. The foliage returns in spring and is bright green but, maturing to deep green. Flowers are produced in great numbers along the axis of the stems in small clusters and are creamy white. In most years when good pollination takes place the round fruit, (berry), grows and changes from green to red just as the foliage begins to turn yellow, when the foliage drops for the winter the colorful fruit is exposed on gray stems.",

        "Ilex species are Dioecious, meaning there are male and then female individual plants. Females are the ones that produce the attractive fruit or berries that native birds relish during the lean times of very early spring when most fruits are lone gone but yet the insects have not yet hatched or emerged from their winter dormancy. The species that most frequents the large shrub are Bombycilla cedrorum/Cedar Waxwings the most elegant birds in the eastern States. Female hollies are normally covered with varying hues of red berries and more rarely orange or even yellow fruited forms can be seen. The fruit show off their color in fall thru winter most and persist throughout the winter into early spring. The berries are a great Winter nutritional food favorite of songbirds during the late winter months when bird foods is scarce. The fruits are absolutely relished by north bound elegant Cedar Waxwings as their flocks pass back through in spring heading to their northern nesting states. Many other birds species benefit from this easy to grow though drought tolerant species. Possum Haw Holly as it is commonly known will grow in a wide range of soils conditions from clay to sandy and from average moisture to dry (xeric sites. It is even tolerant of shade and or full sun. At maturity it reaches 15'High x 15'Wide. I have made selections of many different forms that I feel have horticultural merit. \n\nThe first is the very darkest red form we have yet seen. It earned the named 'N3 Micco Menawa' in honor of one of the Northern Creek/Muscogee Chiefs that fought for his peoples culture being destroyed and their land being stolen by the white illegal aliens. The selection 'Warren's Red', was has been long established in the trade will have to bow its head to our new introduction 'N3 Micco Menawa' in the contest of darkest Blood Red  and Glossiest forms.\n\nI have also a bi-colored reddish orange and yellowish orange fruited form I named 'N3 Fuswvlke Toyis', pronounced Foosh-waugay Dtoyis, which means in Muscogee (My clan is Bird). \n\n'N3 Ochesse Fire' that we are working to root is a nice rich red very heavy fruited selection with a 10'x10'equal height to spread ratio.  \n\nAnother we are working to root is a very tall up right form with large fruit red. I have named it 'N3 Hvce Estecate',pronounced Ha-ge Es-ta-ga-de which translates (Tall Native American), in Muscogee.\n\nWe also have the stunning yellow fruited form 'Finches Gold' discovered in Alabama, \n\nand the interesting weeping red fruited form 'Memphis bell' occasionally available.",

The flower are 4\" long and open to 3\" wide and produce huge fruit for a Habranthus and are filled with viable seed. It is hands down the largest and grandest Rain lily in our collection of some 18 species and selections. Our good friend Rob Mc elwee believes it was genetically altered by Steven F. Austin science Laboratory. Boy, I believe him because I have never had a H. brachyandrus perform like this one.",

The foliage of Black Gum is dark glossy green variable in size and shape in summer. It can be oval, elliptical or obovate and 2-5\" long. It is lustrous with entire often wavy margins. The fall color usually changes from burgundy purplish, to flaming orange, to intense scarlet, to blood red before it drops.  The flower s are very small, in greenish-white in clusters at the top of terminal branches. The fruits are  Blue to black, about .5\" long and oily.

There simply is no comparison to this very rich bright Red form I found in the Coweta Co. Georgia in fall of 2006. It has earned the recognition for having the most outstanding red color and shine of all Ilex decidua selections. \n\nI named it 'N3 Micco Menawa' translates Chief Men-na-wa. I felt it fitting to  name this fabulous selection in honor of his bravely putting his life on the line for his people. Micco Menawa lead the 1000 Upper Muscogee/Creek homeland defense force and fought without fear along with his worriers in defense of their culture being destroyed and land being stolen by the arrogant white illegal aliens. He was one of the most fierce war leaders with a gentlest heart for his enemies children and women of all the Red Sticks warriors and did his best to stop the invasion and genocide of the Eastern Native People when the Manifest Destiny attitude prevailed during the 1800s. Sadly it still survives in many narrow minds today. Micco Menawa fought fearlessly to defend the last town of Tohopeka, now disgracefully called (Horseshoe Bend Military Nat'l Park), where Andrew Jackson's war party of 5000 over whelmed the Muscogee fortress and only because of Gen. Jackson convincing the Cherokee and Southern Creeks that if they helped him capture or kill the Red Stick Traditionalists they would get to stay on their mother lands. Well they wrongly trusted him Andrew lying Jackson and with 1000 of white fighters fought with him burning the last independent Muscogee town and killing over half of the 1000 Red Stick Warriors (nearly 800). Micco Menawa survived the this fierce last battle, but was severely injured with seven wounds. Once recovered he lead a war party to killed Micco McIntosh for selling their land out from under the Muscogee Nation without all Chiefs and Peoples approval which was  against the Muscogee law. Years before the Trial of Tears of the lied to Cherokee people, Micco Menawa died on the long walk when thousands of native Creek people where force ably removed under blood thirsty, arrogant President Andrew Jackson Criminal Indian Removal Act from their home lands to Oklahoma. Menawa's resting place is unknown along with thousands of others who died on these dreadful marches.

This oak grows into a very large tree, quickly for the first 10 years to about 15'High then slows down its growth rate as its canopy starts to develop.

        "Now extinct in the wild this beautiful species which (Father) John and (Son) William Bartram discovered in 1765 along the Altamaha River in South Georgia and named in honor of John's Good friend Benjamin Franklin. The botanical species name alatamaha comes from a common misspelling of the Altamaha River in those days. Later John's son William Bartram returned to collected seed and propagated it at their Philadelphia garden and this is where all plants to see today originate from. The species has never been seen naturally in the wild since 1803. Many Thanks go to people like William and many others for bring native species into cultivation for this can the best measure off preventing extinction today. It has large white flowers with yellow centers that bloom from mid summer to late fall. It is an under story tree that reaches a height of about 20 feet. We have grown it in full sun with success, but more success can been witnessed in high 4-8' raise beds in dapple sun and partial shade in the South where red clay is prevailent. In cooler climates it will tolerate sun better. It prefers soils that drain well with constant moisture, but that is  never wet. Some theorists believe that the Ice Age forced this plant south hence it not being commom at any time in the south due to it be a in an area where it only survived not thrived. I tend follow this belief because it appear to perform much better the futher north one tries to grow it.",

All of the roots when cut at any point die so the palm must regenerate new roots from its base which creates a huge energy load from the Palms trunk.

        "Serenoa repens Silver form is another under used native palm. Well known in the medical field for the properties it offers in fighting disease and the use of it fronds for crafters for making palmetto hats and other woven crafts. This species is very similar to the dwarf palmetto at first glance, but with minimal observation you will notice Serenoas more stately appearance and habit. Its fronds are more upright, compact and rigid, and the petioles are armed with small sharp teeth (serrated) so to resemble a saw, hence the common name Saw Palmetto. It normally produces 4'High trunks, but can grow and reach up to 6+'High with shade and warm climates. In cooler zones such 7b, where we are, the Serenoa repens rarely develops a sizable trunk or 3'. Planted on the southern exposure against a structure or forest, probably best grown as an under story plant in a forest to give it the best chance for success in cooler climates. This silver Saw Palmetto has a much more restricted range. Its greatest population is along the east coast of Florida, the green form is distributed over a much more extensive range from South Carolina to Texas. As one leaves from Florida the less frequent the Green form becomes.",

Average height at maturity is about 70-100'High x 40'Wide. The nuts were a favorite of the extinct carrier pigeon and today are still a favorite to blue jays, titmice, grosbeaks, nuthatches and woodpeckers. It prefers full sun and rich moist well-drained sites.",

In my opinion it is the most showy of all wild lilies in world. It performs best in soils that are constant moisture, especially during the growing season. As tall as this species can get one needs to provide some form of wind protection from strong summer storm blast. They are usually found in rich moist soils, but can adapt well the drier conditions.

This species is very similar to the dwarf palmetto, but there are 3 big differences. 1st it will form a slender trunks usually multiple in numbers on mature specimens. 2nd the frond are smaller and rigid and almost cupped in shape. 3 is the frond stem or petioles are serrated like a saw blade, hence it's common name Saw Palmetto. A small short trunk to 6' in height will develop in warmer climates, but in cooler zone 7, the Serenoa repens rarely develops a sizable trunk. Planted on the southern exposure side or as an under story plant in a forest will offer the best chance for success in cooler climates.",

Dark green foliage, which is back drop for the white flowers, from spring through Autumn and the fall color changes in succession from rich deep reddish purple, scarlet, crimson, them finally fluorescent red holding this color long into winter. If any shrub were to be called a Burning Bush this is the shrub. The fall color is almost unrivaled by any other plant, except Acer luecoderme. In milder climates where the temperatures do not drop below 15 degrees it remains evergreen with its beautiful color. This selection was found in Troup county Georgia by Jim Rodgers and introduced by Nearly Native Nursery. It is a wonderful erosion control along creek banks and drainage ditches with its stoloniferous, (spreads by way of underground stems) growth habit that develops into a colony. A great choice for stream banks, low moist areas where it naturally is found, or a background for lower growing shrubs and perennials. Once established Virginia Sweetspire can tolerate drought very well. One application that it works well with is to use it as the foundation plant in a moist area and have other natives such as a Lindera benzoin female, Sabal minor, Rhododendron viscosum, Cliftonia monophylla, Cyrilla racemiflora, Taxodium ascendens or an other moisture loving shrub or tree. Any of these combinations are very attractive together and create a natural look to the landscape. This wonderful native of the southeastern U.S., is an easy to grow shrub and reaches 3-4'High at maturity. It can spread to 10+'wide and will develop an almost impenetrable barrier.",

        "Lilium michiganense is another exquisite charmer of a native lily species too often bush hogged down or chemically sprayed by county and state DOT crews and ignorant home owners. One of the most highly sought of the lily species, this species is native from and northern Ala. and Ga. throughout the northeastern states of the eastern Us. This species was once far more plentiful in the northeast than it is today. European settlement followed by the industrial age has led to much destruction of this species and others range. This species thrives in damp cool soils, bogs and other various habitats. While the later conditions are ideal it will grow in loamy sand, high organic, or heavy clay based soils as long as it does not dehydrate during Jan.- August. I prefer damp clay based soils to aid in combating the voles ability to tunnel. Like other native lilies, this species has gracefully whorled foliage, maturing normally to 3'high at flowering, but in deep shade may reach to 4-6'high. 3-4\" flowers are produced in the upper portion and hang pendulously with strongly recurved petals and sepals on 4-7\" pedicles (Flower stems). Up to 25 flowers can be produced per plant in ideal conditions. Flower color among this species varies with the range from yellow gold to orange/red. NOTE: They are highly attractive to long legged goats (deer), rabbits and voles. Watch for aphids and at the first sign address them immediately as aphids can spread viruses quickly and kill plants. Excessive over head water is not recommend for native lilies. Organic fertilizers are best.",

Its large lavender to purple flower heads are packed closely together and extends 2/3 of the flowering spike that can reach 3-4'High. This drought tolerant perennial is a favorite nectar provider of late summer and early fall butterflies as well as it supplies seed for many bird species. Liatris thrive in dry sunny conditions. Do not plant them too deep. When planting the top of the cromb should be right at the soil surface.",

I have given it the only name appropriate 'N3 Georgia Jaguar'. With the heavy spotting it seems a perfect match to honor the now threatened and stunning creature that once upon a time roamed this land.

While the later conditions are ideal it will grow in loamy sand, high organic, or heavy clay based soils as long as it does not dehydrate during Jan.- August.

Like other native lilies, this species has gracefully whorled foliage, maturing to 3'high at flowering, but in deep shade may reach to 4-5'high. 3-4\" pendulous flowers are produced in the upper portion and hang with slightly recurved petals and sepals on 4-7\" pedicles (flower stems). Flower color among botanical varieties range from yellow gold to brick red. Our selection of(Variety editorum) is form the southern most population that is red in color. NOTE: They are highly attractive to the long legged goats (deer), rabbits and voles. Watch for aphids and at the first sign address them immediately as aphids can spread viruses quickly and kill plants. Excessive over head water is not recommend for native lilies.

        "After many years of growing this species we finally have enough to offer. It is commonly thought that this species must be grown in rocky shoals. While this may be the best condition for it, it is not the only way for it to be grown. We have found Hymenocallis coronaria to perform just fine in shallow ponds and pond margins. Smaller creeks and streams work well to, but be sure to anchor your bulb very solidly. Because the Homo sapien population has doubled in the last fifty years and developed a large percentage of the East. In turn we get extreme flooding as the result of to much impervious surfacing. These fast moving floods will strip the creeks and river of plants, including the Shoal Spider Lily, and kills some aquatic life. Because of the pollution and siltation of our southeastern streams and river this species it going to to have an uphill battle for survival in the wild. One big benefit of extreme heavy flood is that these forceful flood wash human discarded trash and debris, which is mostly construction debris, lunch cups and bags away from the stream beds and deposits it in deeper down stream bodies of water. Out of sight, but not always harmless to the stream Eco-system.",

It is a stunning red form of this normally tangerine orange lily species ranging from east Texas to north Fla. north to the mid Atlantic states. It is found typically on hardwood hillsides, but Michaux's Lily will grow almost anywhere as long as it is in a well drained site. I named in Honor and Memory of Micco Lamochattee, pronounced Lum-hee (Lvmhe) meaning Eagle and Cat-tae (Cate) meaning Red. Note: They are highly attractive to long legged goats (deer), rabbits and voles. Watch for aphids and at the first sign address them immediately as aphids can spread viruses quickly and kill plants. Excessive over head water is not recommend for native lilies. Organic fertilizers are best.\n\nQuick History: Chief Red Eagle's war name was Hopnicafutsahia, or (Truth Teller) Born (c. 1765-81? - March 24, 1824). His English name was Bill Weatherford and as a Muscogee/Creek Chief of the Upper Creeks as one thoughtful chiefs of the many that lead the Red Sticks offensive in the Creek War (1811-1814) against the invasion of European immigrants with their arrogant  attitudes that were trespassing. Driving of thousands of free living Creeks from their homeland after a treaty was signed with that Superior Manifest Destiny Attitude.\n\nThis man was among the first of the original Homeland Security Team Members in the south! Bill Weatherford was of mixed blood. His father was Charles Weatherford, a Scottish trader and his mother was Sehoy a Itis or Muscogee Native. He was strongly opposed to the invading whites as was Chief Menawa (Ilex decidua 'N3 Micco Menawa') and Peter Mc Queen. The three of them with others headed the Red Stick 800-1000 homeland security force team members on the war path to retain and preserve their cultural ways and stop the uncontrolled burning of their homes, stealing and killing of Native Creeks farmland and animals. The Creek American War was started by US troops during 1811 when a small band of red sticks were attacked out side of Mobile,Ala while they were bring munitions back from Pensacola. since that first battle which the creeks won they planned a massive attack on Fort Mimms in retaliation. A months later August 30, 1813 they staged their positioned on Fort Mimms, Honorably Chief Red Eagle advised not to kill women and children, but his pleases suggestions were ignored and as the anger boiled in the blood of his warriors, so the attack against the fort went on killing mostly white Europeans, some Blacks and Lower Creeks that had taken refuge in the fort. Some 400-500 of the Fort Mimms people were kill that day. The attack known as the Fort Mimms Massacre.",

Scratch the surface with a rake and sow seeds sparingly, water in and label with date and species of seed sown. Usually some (25%) will bloom the first year the other remaining seedlings will develop a ferny rosettes of basal foliage the first summer then they will over winter and bloom the next summer.

It's broad distribution ranged from Georgia to Maine and as far west as the Ohio Valley. This tree was an important component in the ecosystem of hardwood forest and sometime in the very early 1900's a human introduced an Asian fungus,(Endothia parasitica), which quickly killed approximately 99.9 percent of the species. By the 1950's only an estimated 100 trees remained of the original estimated four billion tree population which was the cornerstone of our Eastern Hardwood forest.\nThrough some fellow Botanists and avid Naturalists as well as the American Chestnut Foundation's research we have received young, healthy, professionally selected and so far disease free American Chestnut trees to grow out. The semi-mature and mature specimens from which the seed came from are so far disease free which is promising, but does not guarantee that any of the young plants will endure blight affected areas. We must continue to plant young plants of this species to hopefully find the native genetics that will be resistant to the Blight. It is our hope that you will join us and many others in taking a chance to re-establish this Natural Heritage Tree. \nJoin us and fellow Botanists, Naturalists, and The American Chestnut Foundation in helping to bring back this American Heritage species back from the grips of extinction.",

Flower color among botanical varieties range from yellow gold to red. This is the normal color form which is orange in color.
